## 📖 About The Project

**PrismCalc** is not just a calculator; it is a visual experience. Designed with a strict "No-Framework" philosophy, it runs entirely on **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It features a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic (frosted glass) and is architected as a **Multi-Page Static App**, rejecting the complexity of modern SPAs in favor of raw performance and simplicity.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **💎 Holographic Glass UI:** Deep space gradients with frosted glass cards and neon accents.
* **👻 Ghost Results:** Real-time "Live Preview" of the answer before you even hit equals.
* **👨‍💻 Code Mode:** An educational toggle that translates your math into valid JavaScript code (`const sum = 10 + 5;`) in real-time.
* **🎹 Cyber Sounds:** Custom synthesized sound effects (Mechanical Thock, Glitch Delete, Success Chime) generated purely via the Web Audio API (No MP3 files!).
* **🏦 The Vault:** A dedicated History page that persists data via `localStorage`.
    * **Time Travel:** Click any history item to restore it and edit.
    * **Data Sovereignty:** Export your calculation history to **CSV** instantly (Offline).
* **⌨️ Full Keyboard Support:** Type naturally with your Numpad with visual lighting feedback.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript.
* **Icons:** [Remixicons](https://remixicon.com/) (CDN).
* **Fonts:** JetBrains Mono (Google Fonts).
* **Architecture:** Multi-Page Static Site (`index.html` + `vault.html`).
* **Storage:** Browser `localStorage` (No Database).
* **Audio:** Native Web Audio API (Oscillators).
